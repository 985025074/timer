# timer 
A very simple tool to help control pc time.
# quickstart:
if you have uv:
```shell
uv run main.py
```
if you want to run this as a cli tool, you can create a soft link to /usr/bin.
(I used to try package mode,but I failed to include mp3 file into the project(no doc found))  

# try cooler version! powered by rich
uv run cool_timer.py  
I am going to make a GUI Version of it,it is not satisfying.
